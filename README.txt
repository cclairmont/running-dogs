To my knowledge all aspects of this lab have been implemented correctly.  The
page works on Chrome and Firefox, I am unable to install Safari on my computer
and thus do not know if it works on Safari.  In order to make it work with
Firefox I had to convert the mp3 file to ogg, as Firefox does not support mp3
files.

I spent approximately 1 hour on this assignment.
